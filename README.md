## Objective
In this game two players need to reach the desired destination(the finish flag of respective colors), the one reaching first will win the game.

## Twist
To make game interesting each player is provided with 8 fences to make opponent's path difficult.

## Rules
* When its your turn, you can move your car forward, backward, left or right; only one square at a time or can either put up a fence.  
* Fence can block only two squares completely,are limited in number i.e each of them can use a maximum of 8 fences & the opponent should not be blocked completely.  
* One route must be available to the opponent,if failing to do so the player who blocked the car will lose the game.  
* If there is a fence any player cannot move the car over it.A fence can not be overlapped and it cannot pass from the middle of the another fence.  
* When two cars come face to face, one car can jump over the other in its turn ,also the car can jump to the left or right of the opponent's car,provided there is no fence in the middle.  
* The car that reaches first on the square having the finish flag of it's color, is declared as the winner.
